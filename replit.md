## Recent Changes & Bug Fixes

### October 2025
- **CRITICAL: Image Upload Fixes (Latest)**: Fixed three critical bugs preventing image uploads from working: (1) `apiRequest` returning Response object instead of JSON; (2) Uppy result doesn't have `uploadURL` property; (3) Stale closure in upload handlers. Solution: Changed all upload components (Gallery, Hero, Trends) to use `useRef` instead of `useState` for storing presigned URLs, ensuring the `onComplete` handler always accesses the latest URL value. Upload flow now works correctly: admin uploads → Uppy gets presigned URL → saves to ref → upload completes → form gets URL from ref → POST creates record → ACL route updates to stable `/objects/...` path.
- **CRITICAL: Persistent Image Storage via Replit App Storage**: Implemented persistent image storage using Replit App Storage (Google Cloud Storage) to solve image loss across server restarts and republishing. Images now persist indefinitely in cloud storage. Features: Uppy-powered upload interface for Hero background, Gallery images, and Trends images; automatic ACL policy management for public image access; presigned upload URLs for secure file uploads; stable `/objects/...` URLs for reliable image rendering. Upload flow: admin uploads image → receives presigned URL → saves to database → backend sets public ACL policy → returns stable URL → frontend renders uploaded image. All uploaded images are publicly accessible via `/objects/...` routes with proper ACL checks. Dependencies: @uppy/core, @uppy/react, @uppy/dashboard, @uppy/aws-s3, @google-cloud/storage.
- **CRITICAL: Complete PostgreSQL Migration**: Resolved major data persistence bug where all admin changes (services, staff, gallery, settings) were lost on server restart. Migrated entire storage layer from in-memory Maps to PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM. All entities now persist to database: users, bookings, services, staff, site settings, hero content, services section, special offers, gallery images, and trends. Implemented automatic database seeding with guard logic to prevent duplicate data. All CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) now use proper database queries (`db.select`, `db.insert`, `db.update`, `db.delete`). Verified with manual testing: 62 services, 4 staff members, 14+ gallery images all persist correctly across server restarts.
- **Trends Feature ("What's Trendy Now")**: Replaced NailShapeQuiz with a dynamic trends section where admins can showcase lookbooks, nail trends, and seasonal highlights. Full PostgreSQL integration with CRUD operations via admin panel. Trends are organized by category (e.g., "Nail Trends", "Lookbook"), display with Framer Motion animations, and feature responsive card layouts with hover effects. Section automatically hides when no trends exist. Admin can manage title, description, image, category, and display order for each trend.
- **2025 Warm Minimalist Design System**: Complete rebrand with sophisticated color palette: rich black (#0B0B0B), off-white (#F5F5F5), neutral grey (#BDBDBD), and warm taupe accent (#A89B8E). Removed all duplicate CSS blocks to ensure single source of truth for colors. Hero section redesigned with bold "THE MR Studio" typography, warm dark background with blurred cover photo, and subtle grain/noise overlay. Footer enhanced with warm taupe gradient line and smooth social icon hover fades. All themes updated to support both light and dark modes.
- **Interactive NailShapeQuiz Component**: Added engaging quiz feature to services page that recommends ideal nail shapes based on lifestyle, preferences, and style. Features smooth Framer Motion animations, bilingual Georgian/English content, and seamless booking integration. Quiz includes 6 nail shape profiles (square, round, oval, almond, stiletto, coffin) with personalized recommendations.
- **Next-Gen Motion Enhancements**: Elevated visuals with cursor-tracked 3D tilt effects on gallery images (±10° rotation following pointer), Framer Motion-powered staggered animations (0.05s gallery, 0.15s services), smooth category transitions (150ms fade), and luxury minimalist spacing. Gallery and Services sections now feature fluid scroll-triggered animations, enhanced typography scaling (up to 6xl), and unified transform system preventing CSS/JS conflicts. All motion effects use Framer Motion's spring physics for premium, editorial feel.
- **Ultra-Modern Design Transformation**: Complete visual redesign with editorial aesthetic, featuring Playfair Display typography for headlines, premium glass effects on header, smooth hover interactions (lift, zoom, border accents), and generous white space. Modern effects include: parallax scrolling hero, scroll progress indicator, magnetic buttons, ripple click effects, animated gradients, image reveal animations, skeleton loading states, and smooth scroll-triggered fade-ins. All functionality preserved.
- **Admin Password Updated**: Changed default admin password to "Wadisheni1." for enhanced security.
- **Two-Way Google Calendar Sync**: Website now reads from Google Calendar to check availability, preventing double-bookings when staff manually add events. Uses Freebusy API to query all staff calendars in batch. Properly converts times to Asia/Tbilisi timezone. Gracefully falls back to database-only if Calendar API unavailable.
- **Enhanced Service Update Validation**: Added Zod schema validation to service update endpoint with proper error handling and logging for better data integrity.
- **Fixed Staff Management Bug**: Corrected `apiRequest` parameter order in StaffEditor component. All CRUD operations (create, update, delete) now work correctly with Georgian characters. Backend validation added for proper error handling.
- **Fixed Booking Availability Logic**: Time slots now correctly block based on full booking duration, not just start time. Handles edge cases like mid-hour bookings (e.g., 12:45 + 30min properly blocks both 12:00 and 13:00).
- **Fixed Booking Modification Bug**: Changing only duration no longer sets time field to undefined.
- **Email Notifications**: Admin receives instant email alerts for new bookings (requires EMAIL_USER/EMAIL_PASS in Secrets, admin email configured in Settings tab).

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend uses React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite for bundling, and Wouter for routing. It leverages Shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS) for its component system, following atomic design principles. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS with a custom theme supporting three switchable color themes (Ivory Noir, Nude Minimal, Cool Spa) and Google Fonts (Playfair Display, Cormorant Garamond, Inter, Neue Haas Grotesk). State management relies on TanStack Query for server state and local React state for UI, employing responsive, mobile-first design.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is built with Express.js and TypeScript, using ESM modules and a middleware-based request/response pipeline. It features a RESTful API with centralized route registration and robust error handling. All data operations use PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM with an abstract storage interface for flexible data management. Session management uses PostgreSQL-backed sessions via connect-pg-simple for persistence across server restarts.

### Database Architecture
Drizzle ORM is used for type-safe database operations and schema management, with a schema-first approach and Drizzle-Zod for runtime validation. The schema includes all application entities: `users`, `staff`, `bookings`, `services`, `site_settings`, `hero_content`, `services_section`, `special_offers`, `gallery_images`, and `trends` tables. PostgreSQL is integrated via the Neon serverless driver with WebSocket configuration for scalable and edge-compatible database access. All CRUD operations use database queries for full data persistence. Session persistence is managed via connect-pg-simple with automatic session table creation. Database seeding occurs automatically on first run with guard logic to prevent duplicates.

### UI/UX Decisions
The design emphasizes sophisticated minimalism inspired by premium beauty brands, focusing on trust-building, breathing room, and clear visual hierarchy. It utilizes switchable color themes, elegant typography, and a responsive image gallery. All public-facing content is available in Georgian with selected English branding elements. Service category cards feature a clean, text-only design without decorative icons to maintain the understated, elegant aesthetic.

### Feature Specifications

Business hours: 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM (20:00) with hourly time slots. Default appointment duration is 1.5 hours (90 minutes). Bookings start with "pending" status and require admin approval before confirmation. Admin can modify booking time and duration (30min, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 3h) before approving. Google Calendar integration: creates events upon admin approval AND reads from staff calendars to show real-time availability (prevents double-booking when staff manually add events to Google Calendar).
- **Booking Management Admin Panel**: Dedicated "Bookings" tab (first tab in admin dashboard) with separate sections for pending and confirmed bookings. Admins can approve, reject (with optional reason), or modify (time/duration) pending booking requests. Approved bookings automatically move to confirmed section and create Google Calendar events.
